## Exhaustive Search

Tries all possible candidate solutions until an answer is found. A naive, brute-force approach will not perform efficiently and complexity
can grow exponentially, making it hard for computers to process.

## Backtracking
Backtracking improves the concept of exhaustive search by avoiding the creation of unnecessary candidate solutions. This 
is achieved by going back to the point before the problem's constraints were still valid, then a next "branch" for our solution
can be created from that point.

Backtracking is an important improvement over the brute-force approach of exhaustive search. It provides a convenient method for generating candidate solutions while making it possible to avoid generating unnecessary candidates. The main idea is to construct solutions one component at a time and evaluate such partially constructed candidates as follows: If a partially constructed solution can be developed further without violating the problemâ€™s constraints, it is done by taking the first remaining legitimate option for the next component. If there is no legitimate option for the next component, no alternatives for any remaining component need to be considered. In this case, the algorithm backtracks to replace the last component of the partially constructed solution with the next option for that component.

## Transform and conquer

The transform-and-conquer is a well-known approach to problem solving that is based on the idea of transformation. 
A problem is solved in two stages. First, in the transformation stage, it is modified or transformed into another problem that, 
for one reason or another, is more amenable to solution. Then, in the second, conquering stage, it is solved.

### Decrease and Conquer
This strategy is based on the relationship between a smaller instance of the problem and the main solution. This 
solution usually leads to a recursive algorithm.
